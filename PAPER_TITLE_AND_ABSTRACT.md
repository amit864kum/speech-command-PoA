## 📝 **ABSTRACT** (250 words)

Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it particularly suitable for sensitive applications such as speech recognition. However, existing FL systems face critical challenges including privacy leakage through gradient attacks, Byzantine attacks from malicious clients, and lack of model verification mechanisms. In this paper, we present BlockFL, a comprehensive framework that integrates differential privacy, Byzantine-robust aggregation, and blockchain-based verification for secure federated speech recognition. Our system employs Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to provide formal privacy guarantees with configurable privacy budgets (ε), implements multiple robust aggregation methods including Krum and Trimmed Mean to defend against Byzantine attacks, and utilizes blockchain with InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for transparent model tracking and fraud detection. We introduce a novel commit-reveal protocol with Merkle proofs for efficient model verification and automated slashing mechanisms for malicious participants. Extensive experiments on the Google Speech Commands dataset with 10-50 clients demonstrate that our system achieves 85.2% accuracy without privacy protection, maintains 76.8% accuracy with strong privacy guarantees (ε=1.0), and shows robust performance against up to 30% Byzantine clients with only 9% accuracy degradation using Krum aggregation. The system scales linearly with the number of clients while maintaining acceptable training time. To the best of our knowledge, BlockFL is the first comprehensive framework combining differential privacy, Byzantine robustness, and blockchain verification for federated speech recognition. Our complete implementation with over 8,500 lines of code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducibility and future research.
