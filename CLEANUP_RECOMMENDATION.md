# Documentation Cleanup Recommendation

## Files to Delete (Safe)

These files served their purpose during development but are now redundant:

### 1. Development Progress Files
- ❌ **CHANGES_PHASE3.md** - Change log (info now in PHASE3_COMPLETE.md and FINAL_STATUS.md)
- ❌ **ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md** - Original roadmap (work is complete, outdated)
- ❌ **IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md** - Progress tracking (superseded by FINAL_STATUS.md)
- ❌ **PHASE2_COMPLETE.md** - Phase 2 notes
